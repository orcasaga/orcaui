# OrcaUI: The Power of Simplicity 🐋✨

## 🌊 The Name
**OrcaUI = Orca (killer whale) + UI (User Interface)**  
The name draws inspiration from the orca - nature's apex predator that also demonstrates remarkable intelligence and social cooperation. Just as orcas interact harmoniously with their environment, OrcaUI prioritizes seamless user experience across all application scenarios, making development intuitive and enjoyable.

## 🚀 Overview
OrcaUI is an innovative frontend UI framework built entirely with native **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** - no dependency on Vue, React or other third-party libraries.

🔌 **Leveraging Web Components technology**, our components work like native HTML tags out of the box:
- ⚡ No complex configuration
- 🛠️ No build tools required  
- 📖 No new syntax to learn

Simply include OrcaUI's core file, and use our semantic components as naturally as you'd use standard `<button>` or `<input>` elements.

🎨 We embrace a **minimalist philosophy**:
- 🚫 No over-engineering

This simplicity enables:
- 🆕 Beginners to get started in **under 10 minutes**
